# Readme Urbalurba Infrastructure

This is the readme for the Urbalurba Infrastructure.

## Overview

The goal of the Urbalurba Infrastructure is to provide a environment for developers, system admins and devops engineers that can be used to develop, test and deploy applications.

It is a full infrastructure stack that has the services that the cloud infrastructure providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) provide.

This is done by provisioning a full infrastructure that runs on a single machine like the developers laptop. The same infrastructure can be deployed to the cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises. So if the application works on the developers laptop then the same application will work in the cloud or on-premises.

The stack provides open source versions of the services that the cloud providers offer. It contains services like databases, message queues, monitoring, logging, etc. 


Notes:

- It solves the problem of "it works on my machine" 
- It is a full infrastructure stack that has the services that the cloud infrastructure providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) provide.
- It is a single machine that can be deployed to the cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premises.
- It is a full infrastructure stack that can be used to develop, test and deploy applications.
- The developer has full control over the dev and test environment. Not needing any permissions in the cloud during development and test.
- The cloud infrastructure team dont need to provide any permissions in the cloud during development and test.

TODO: analyze  the doc folder and the markdown readme files there to create a overall readme for the infrastructure.
