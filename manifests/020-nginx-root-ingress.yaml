# File: 020-nginx-root-ingress.yaml
# Description: Sets up Ingress for Nginx using Traefik as the ingress controller
#
# CATCHALL/FALLBACK CONFIGURATION:
# - This creates a fallback rule for all paths not defined elsewhere in Traefik
# - All requests that don't match other Ingress rules will be sent to Nginx
# - More specific path-based routes (like /apim) will take precedence
# - Nginx serves as the default backend for any undefined paths
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - This configuration uses Traefik as the ingress controller (not nginx ingress)
# - It configures a default route (/) for any host
# - This works with Tailscale funnel → Traefik → Nginx routing pattern
#
# Traffic Flow:
# Tailscale funnel → Traefik ingress controller → Nginx service → Nginx pods → PVC content
